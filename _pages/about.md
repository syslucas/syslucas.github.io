# A short introduction
I am a second-year masters's student at Xiamen University (XMU) under the guidance of [Prof. Zhirong Shen](https://shenzr.github.io/).
Prior to attending XMU, I received a bachelor's degree at Tianjin University of Technology in 2020.
I am working in the field of Disaggregated Memory, RDMA Network, and LSM-Tree.
Previously, my research included memory indexing (e.g., hashing index).
